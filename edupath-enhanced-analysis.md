**EduPath: Enhanced System Analysis and Development Plan**

**1. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the comprehensive system analysis and development plan for **EduPath: Your Guide to Academic and Career Success in Cameroon**. EduPath is an innovative web application designed to address the critical education-to-employment mismatch faced by Cameroonian students transitioning from secondary education (GCE Ordinary/Advanced Level or French System equivalents) to higher education. The system will provide personalized, AI-driven recommendations for university programs and career paths, prioritizing those with high employment potential, including opportunities for job creation and self-employment.

The core of EduPath's intelligence lies in its multi-agent architecture, built using the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). This design ensures modularity, scalability, and robust collaboration between specialized AI agents. This document details the system's architecture, component-level functionalities, required technologies, data sources, and a phased implementation strategy, providing a clear roadmap for development.

**2. Overall System Architecture**

EduPath is structured around a client-server model, with a responsive User Interface (UI) interacting with a powerful Backend/Multi-Agent Recommendation Engine. This engine orchestrates various specialized AI agents, which in turn interact with a robust Database layer and a Generative AI Module (powered by Google Gemini).

**Key Components:**

-   **User Interface (UI):** The primary interaction point for students.
-   **Backend / Multi-Agent Recommendation Engine:** The central intelligence hub, comprising several specialized AI agents coordinated by an Orchestrator Agent.
-   **Database Layer:** Stores and manages all structured and unstructured data required by the system.
-   **Generative AI Module:** Integrates Google Gemini for dynamic content generation and personalized feedback.
-   **Feedback Loop Module:** Collects and processes alumni success stories and career trajectory updates.
-   **A/B Testing Framework:** Optimizes recommendation algorithms based on user outcomes.

**High-Level Flow:**

1.  A student interacts with the **UI** to input their academic results and preferences.
2.  The **UI Agent** (part of the Backend) receives this input and passes it to the **Orchestrator Agent**.
3.  The **Orchestrator Agent** delegates tasks to other specialized agents:
    -   **Student Profile Agent:** Processes and stores student data.
    -   **University Program & Admission Agent:** Retrieves and processes university program data.
    -   **Job Market Insights Agent:** Analyzes and provides data on in-demand skills and career trends.
    -   **Scholarship Opportunities Agent:** Identifies and matches available scholarships.
    -   **Vocational Education Agent:** Provides technical/vocational education alternatives.
    -   **Personalized Recommendation Agent:** Synthesizes data from the above agents to generate tailored academic and career recommendations.
    -   **Alumni Feedback Agent:** Processes career trajectory updates from successful graduates.
    -   **Generative AI Module:** Enhances recommendations with personalized content (e.g., study guides, mock interviews).
4.  All agents interact with the **Database Layer** for data storage and retrieval.
5.  The **Orchestrator Agent** compiles the final recommendations and personalized content, sending it back to the **UI** for display to the student.
